    <h2> Learn about my Photography Journey </h2>

    <p>
        When I was 10, I was intrigued by architecture and city layouts. 
        So I started to take pictures of buildings and views that I found 
        entrancing or interesting with my iPhone. As I began to travel, I 
        learned more about composition, color, patterns, light and shadow, and 
        negative space. I would volunteer with my townâ€™s local TV station and help 
        film and do the videography of local programs and events. This taught me more 
        about picture in motion, but there was still a lesson for me to learn about the 
        underlying principle of getting good angles to focus on a subject or object of 
        interest. Finally, when I was 17, my father gifted me a Nikon digital camera, 
        and I began to heavily play around with it and meticulously watch Youtube videos 
        to learn how cameras function. I learned a lot more about the important components 
        of aperture, ISO, and shutter speed. Although it took a a long while, I would say 
        that I have learnt the basics and continue to learn more about photography through 
        shooting and speaking with other photographers. My main photography focuses are 
        street, nature, and landscape photography. Right now, I am learning more about the 
        after-process of shooting and how to edit my photos on Lightroom and other platforms 
        to enhance the artistic aspect I want out of a photo. The first image was taken at The Vessel in New York City
        and the second image was taken at the MFA in Boston.
