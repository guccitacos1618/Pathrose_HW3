    <h2> About Aria </h2>

    <p>I am a fourth-year student at Northeastern University in Boston, MA, majoring in 
        Business Administration with a concentration in Finance and minoring in Data Science 
        and Economics. One of my interests that I have really developed outside of my academics 
        and extracurriculars is hiking with my dog, Aria. Born in Pennsylvania, Aria is a 
        four-year-old Australian Shepherd that currently lives in Massachusetts with my family. 
        Together, we have hiked and walked through Mount Wachusett, Mount Monadnock, Acadia National 
        Park, the Bruce Freeman Trail, the Blue Hills Reservation, and a lot more. I got into hiking 
        because as the pandemic regulations became less restrictive, I wanted to get outside and explore
         nature. Thankfully, I had Aria, who was a young puppy then, to motivate me as her breed is highly
          energetic and needs a lot of exercise anyways. In this way, I feel that Aria has kept me on track. 
          Through hiking, I have also further practiced with my passion in photography as a lot of the hikes 
          offer scenic views of the land below, fun pictures of animals and rock patters, and great shot 
          opportunities of my friends and family. I hope to try hiking in the winter as I feel like that 
          would be new and perhaps refreshing, and Aria loves to play in the snow (and eat it!). The image below 
        is of Aria at Mount Monadnock </p>
